Feature: Fix KeyError position
Analysis: 1. Feature Breakdown:
The feature request is about fixing a KeyError position. This suggests that there is an issue with the way keys are being accessed or used in a dictionary or similar data structure. The KeyError typically occurs when a key that doesn't exist in the dictionary is being accessed. The request to "fix" this error could mean either handling the error more gracefully or ensuring that the key exists before it is accessed.

2. Required Components:
   - Debugging: The first step is to identify where the KeyError is occurring in the codebase.
   - Error handling: Implement a mechanism to handle KeyError exceptions. This could be as simple as using a try/except block in Python, or a similar construct in other languages.
   - Code modification: If the KeyError is due to an attempt to access a key that doesn't exist, the code may need to be modified to check if the key exists before accessing it.
   - Testing: After the fix is implemented, it should be tested to ensure the KeyError no longer occurs and that the fix hasn't introduced any new issues.

3. Implementation Complexity:
The complexity of implementing this feature request can vary greatly depending on the cause of the KeyError. If it's a simple case of a missing key, the fix could be relatively straightforward. However, if the KeyError is symptomatic of a larger issue, such as a design flaw in the data structure or a synchronization issue in a multi-threaded environment, the fix could be quite complex. Regardless, the first step is to thoroughly investigate the issue to understand its root cause.
Plan: Development Plan:

File Structure:
- src/
  - main.py (Main application file where the KeyError is occurring)
  - utils.py (Utility functions, including error handling)
- tests/
  - test_main.py (Tests for main application)
  - test_utils.py (Tests for utility functions)

Implementation Phases:

1. Investigation:
   - Identify the exact location of the KeyError in the codebase.
   - Understand the context in which the error is occurring.
   - Determine whether the error is due to a missing key or a larger issue.

2. Design:
   - Design a solution based on the findings from the investigation phase.
   - If the error is due to a missing key, plan to implement a key existence check before accessing it.
   - If the error is due to a larger issue, design a solution to address the root cause.

3. Implementation:
   - Implement the designed solution.
   - Add error handling for KeyError exceptions.
   - Modify the code to check for key existence before accessing it, if necessary.

4. Testing:
   - Write unit tests to ensure the KeyError no longer occurs.
   - Test the entire application to ensure no new issues have been introduced.

5. Review and Refactor:
   - Review the code for any possible improvements.
   - Refactor the code if necessary.

Key Functions:

1. `handle_key_error()`: This function will be responsible for handling KeyError exceptions. It will be located in utils.py.

2. `check_key_existence()`: This function will check if a key exists in a dictionary before accessing it. It will also be located in utils.py.

3. `main()`: This is the main function of the application where the KeyError is occurring. The function will be modified to use `handle_key_error()` and `check_key_existence()`. It will be located in main.py.
