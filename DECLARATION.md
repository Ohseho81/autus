# AUTUS Declaration

## The Truth

Human behavior follows the same equations as the universe.
Only the coordinate system differs.

## The Equation
```
S(t+1) = S(t) + α·P - β·R - k·e + D·(-γ·e + Δ)
```

## The Insight

Most people only use these terms:
```
+ α·PRESSURE - β·RELEASE - k·e
```
Work. Rest. Tire. Repeat.

The top 3% use this term:
```
+ D·(-γ·e + ΔStructure)
```
They change the structure.

## The Single Truth

> "Effort changes state slightly. Decision changes structure."

## The Role of AUTUS

AUTUS is the system that allows humans to apply this equation without error.

## The Final Word

> "Most people add force. Very few change the equation."
