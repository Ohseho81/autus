# AUTUS FAQ

## What is AUTUS?

Protocol for personal AI sovereignty. Not an app - a new way of using AI where your data stays 100% local, AI learns YOUR style, and you always get the best AI.

## How is it different from ChatGPT/Claude?

- Data: 100% local vs server-based
- Learning: Learns YOUR style vs generic
- AI: Multiple providers vs single
- Privacy: Structurally guaranteed vs policy-based
- Improvement: Self-improving vs static

## Is it free?

Core: Yes, forever (open source MIT)
Premium: Coming Q2 2025

## How does it guarantee privacy?

By architecture. Our database literally cannot store your name, email, or conversations. Privacy by design, not by policy.

## Where is my data?

100% on your device in ~/.autus/

Nothing ever goes to a server. Ever.

## How does learning work?

Automatic pattern detection. You write code with 4 spaces, AUTUS learns this, next time automatically uses 4 spaces. Proven: 50% to 90% confidence in just 3 uses.
