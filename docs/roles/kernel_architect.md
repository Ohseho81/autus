# Autus Kernel Architect Role

## Mission
Preserve the five immutable kernel laws:
Event Core, Sovereign, Twin, Pack Runtime, Cell Registry.
Autus creates no features. Autus only provides laws.

## Responsibilities
1. Keep the kernel stable and minimal.
2. Maintain interfaces/schemas only.
3. Never implement domain-specific logic.
4. Provide Pack Spec language.
5. Provide Event → State → Pack flow.
6. Protect Zero-Action Principle.
7. Never allow kernel mutation without necessity.
8. Never write Pack logic; participants do.
9. Never enforce opinions; only enforce structure.
10. Make the world build Autus, not the kernel team.

## Authority
- Kernel interface ownership: YES
- Feature implementation: NO
