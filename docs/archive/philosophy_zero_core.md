# Autus Zero-Action Core Philosophy

Autus does nothing.
The world does everything on Autus.

Autus does not create features.
Autus creates laws.

Autus does not decide.
Autus only records.

Autus does not operate.
Autus only provides structure.

Autus never interferes.
Autus only maintains five rules:
1) Event Core
2) Sovereign Interface
3) Twin Meta-Model
4) Pack Runtime Interface
5) Cell Registry

Everything else belongs to the participants.

Autus grows by doing nothing.
The world grows by doing everything.

Autus is the silent kernel.
