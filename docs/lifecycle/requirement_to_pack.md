# Requirement → Pack Lifecycle

1. Participant submits a requirement in natural language.
2. Autus converts it into:
   - Event Schema
   - Pack Skeleton
   - Policy Template
3. Participant fills Pack logic.
4. Pack is uploaded to Marketplace.
5. Other cells adopt and evolve it.
6. Patterns feed back into the ecosystem.

Autus does nothing.
Participants do everything.
